Part 1 was far too straightforward which only could mean part 2 was going to be ever so more complex. Recursion again but managed to get my head round it alot easier this time. Part 1 and 2 take almost the same time to run which is very suprising. Part 2 caches numbers in each depth to save repeating it for other occurances. Then just sum up those in depth 0 (the initial stones).
